# Design Guidelines

A codebase-agnostic skill for applying design guidelines across any UI project.

- Installable via terminal
- Source: https://github.com/Wiltermoodj/design
- Format: Open Knowledge Format markdown

## Install

Run the following command from the root of the project you want to install the skill into:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wiltermoodj/design/main/scripts/install-design-skill.sh | bash
```

Alternatively, if you have cloned the `design` repository locally:

```bash
bash /path/to/design/scripts/install-design-skill.sh .
```

### Installed Project Structure

The installer places the guidelines and agent skill directly into your project:

- **Project Root**:
  - `RULES.md` — Agent design system rules and routing matrix
- **Agent Customizations (`.agents/`)**:
  - `.agents/rules/design-rules.md` — Automatic directory rule discovery
  - `.agents/skills/design/SKILL.md` — Core design skill instructions and checklist
  - `.agents/skills/design/REFERENCE.md` — Token lookup tables and specifications
  - `.agents/skills/design/knowledge/` — Design ADR corpus
  - `.agents/skills/design/scripts/` — Automated compliance and remediation scripts

## Validate

```bash
npx -y tsx scripts/ci/validate-frontmatter.ts .
npx -y tsx scripts/ci/validate-links.ts .
```

## Upgrade

Re-run the installation command from your project root at any time to refresh the skill and rules from upstream:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wiltermoodj/design/main/scripts/install-design-skill.sh | bash
```
